                            Social matching systems aim at supporting the<br>
                            creation of new social ties by recommending people<br>
                            to people. In theory, such systems could decrease <br>
                            social barriers for initiating face-to-face interaction <br>
                            with an unfamiliar person and increase social capital.<br> 
                            However, social matching systems currently do not <br>
                            have effective mechanisms to mediate chance <br>
                            encounters and introduce relevant people to each <br>

                            Chance encounters rely on opportunity, meaning that <br>
                            two people have to be in a situation where their paths <br>

                    Dr. Quentin Jones is an Associate Professor with a Ph.D. in <br>Information Systems from University of Haifa, Israel.  He has <br>received many grants from National Science Foundation to <br> develop user-location and social-activity aware mobile <br> applications for community building, collaboration and customer<br> discovery.  To achieve that goal, Dr. Jones built an NJIT test-bed<br> with NSF funding – a wireless and mobile environment for <br> location-based online community. He currently supervises four <br> Ph.D. students working in the area of human-centered <br> computing. Their work advances understanding of connections <br> through social computing applications, specifically: (1) social <br> activity coordination; (2) social activity group coalescing; (3) <br> context-aware social matching; and (4) impression management <br>in online dating systems. <br>
