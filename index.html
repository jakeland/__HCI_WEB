Social matching systems aim at supporting the creation of new social ties by recommending people to people. In theory, such systems could decrease social barriers for initiating face-to-face interaction with an unfamiliar person and increase social capital. However, social matching systems currently do not have effective mechanisms to mediate chance encounters and introduce relevant people to each other at the opportune moment and the opportune place in order to encourage face-to-face interaction. Chance encounters rely on opportunity, meaning that two people have to be in a situation where their paths intersect and they have the opportunity to interact.

One of the primary uses of interpersonal communication channels such as texting, instant messaging and mobile phone conversations is to coordinate social activities, such as the planning of a future face-to-face meeting. The goal of this project is to lay the foundation, through the instantiation of innovative software that embodies lessons learned from studies into everyday social coordination practices, for future work that will significantly expand our knowledge of how to design mobile outeraction-support systems. A particular focus will be to address people's desire for a shared view of the status of the activity planning process (e.g., knowing who can come to an event at a particular time).

                            <p>
                               Despite the importance of individuals coming together for social group activities, the process by which such groups coalesce is poorly understood. Because of this, current technologies that have been built for the purpose of bringing people together have not addressed the social burdens that exist in organizing activities. The goal of this research is to understand the group coalescing process and the extent to which it is suboptimal in urban communities. To address this problem, we will design technological solutions that reduce the burdens individuals face in becoming an organizer. Reducing the burden of leadership effectively increases the chance an individual will step forward to begin the coalescing of a social activity group, leading to successful group activities.

                            <p> 
                               Social matching systems have made it possible to meet people in the physical world in ways that were formerly impossible due to geographical, temporal, and social limitations. A key need for users is the ability to form impressions of other people online that they deem accurate once validated face-to-face. However, we lack a comprehensive understanding of how users evaluate information about each other within these systems for face-to-face meetings. Online dating systems are perhaps the most popular form of social matching systems today, yet research suggests online daters are plagued with impression formation struggles [2, 4].  Research conducted at the Connections Lab uses online dating as a context to understand peopleâ€™s abilities to form accurate impressions of strangers online for face-to-face meetings, and how such abilities can be better facilitated.

                                <p>In December 2012, Doug Zytko was days away from dropping out of the PhD program to open a cafÃ© with JD Salinger-inspired drink names before getting his first conference paper accepted at CSCW. Now in the fourth year of his PhD campaign, Doug uses online dating as a context to understand peopleâ€™s abilities to form accurate impressions of strangers online for face-to-face meetings. His research is the first to investigate impression formation throughout the entire online dating process, including face-to-face meetings. Dougâ€™s dissertation will culminate with the testing of a new impression formation tool for social matching systems.

His research interests include building scalable, distributed software systems and he is currently working towards being able to use data analytics to derive meaning from large data sets. He has developed distributed programs with NodeJS/Redis on Amazon Web Services and sold them as a freelance web developer on ODesk. He hopes that his programming interests and abilities can be effectively used to help those in the Connections Lab to better understand the social network/geotemporal data that is available for them to analyze.
